# goroawase-maker
A Python program that helps you create Goroawase.

# What is Goroawase?
In simple terms, it is a Japanese mnemonic system to memorise numbers. You probably need to speak some Japanese in order to find this helpful. But, for my Japanese friends out there, here you go.

# Dataset
The idea stemmed from this website: http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~b-jack/bn/pken.html. However, it had few things which I thought could be changed to my liking:
1. Maximum number of digits to be entered is 11.
2. The way the website splits long numbers is not random.
3. I wanted to add my own data.
4. It is online. If the website owner takes the website down, we will never be able to enjoy it again.

Thankfully, the owner has made the data publicly available. I am truly grateful for that: http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~b-jack/d-m.html. I wanted to donate, but I couldn't find my way around the website (if you figure it out, please let me know).

Last but not least, there is another nice Goroawase website: https://seoi.net/goro/
